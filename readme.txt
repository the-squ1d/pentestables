Instructions for opping:

1.) Run startop (symlink is on desktop)
 - enter client name
 - startop will then create data structures,
   opnotes, and a tcpdump
2.) Do your op.  Make sure you save all files to the 
    /root/data/CLIENTNAME folder
3.) When you're done, run finishop.sh (symlink is also on desktop)



Files of note:
/root/ops_scripts/ - location of startop.sh, finishop.sh
/root/data/terminal_session_output - location of all terminal output
/root/data/CLIENTNAME - location of pcap file, opnotes, and where you 
                        should be saving EVERYTHING
